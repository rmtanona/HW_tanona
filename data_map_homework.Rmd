##Exercise 1: Advanced Date Manipulation with lubridate
Generate a sequence of dates from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2025, spaced by every two months. Extract the year, quarter, and ISO week number for each date.
```{r exercise1}
dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2015-01-01"), 
                  to = as.Date("2025-12-31"), 
                  by = "2 months")
map_dfc(dates, ~ data.frame(
  date = .x,
  year = year(.x),
  quarter = quarter(.x),
  iso_week = isoweek(.x)
)) -> result1
```

Explanation: Here I used created a sequence of dates as required using seq.Date, saving that value sequence to then use in the map_dfc() command. Then, in mapping this sequence with map_dfc(), I pulled the year, quarter, and iso week as required.
